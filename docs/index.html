                <p>
                    I graduated with honors from Filemon T. Lizan Senior High School, specializing in the STEM strand. During my studies, I developed a strong passion for technology and innovation, focusing on creating versatile tech solutions with multiple applications. My work centered around researching emerging technologies and finding practical ways to solve real-world problems.
                    This experience has fueled my drive to continuously learn and grow in the tech industry, and I am dedicated to developing impactful solutions that make a difference.

            <p>
                Here are some of my recent projects, which I have developed over the past three months. These include: <br><br>

<li>A website tailored for freelance photographers, designed to showcase their portfolios and connect with potential clients.</li>
<li>A basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) attendance management system to streamline tracking and reporting for organizations.</li>
<li>A comprehensive calculator and unit converters system, aimed at providing users with efficient tools for various calculations.</li>
<li>A quiz application that dynamically pulls questions and data from an online database, providing a seamless experience for users.</li>
<br><br>
These projects highlight my commitment to honing my skills and creating functional, user-centric solutions. While I am continually working to enhance my technical expertise, I tend to focus more on the logical structure and functionality of the application rather than just its visual interface. This approach allows me to build solid, scalable solutions that are not only visually appealing but also robust and efficient. I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies to improve my craft and stay updated with the latest trends in the industry.
<br>
As I continue my studies and practical experience, I am eager to take on more challenging projects and grow as a developer.
